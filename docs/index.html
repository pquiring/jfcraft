Yet another implementation of the Mine Craft game.<br>
Written in Java.<br>
Includes 0% Minecraft source or resources.<br>
Uses the Faithful Texture pack.<br>
Is not compatible with the official game in anyway.<br>

Some parts of the game are complete but much is still left to do.<br>
See todo.txt for a full list.<br>
<br>
I've done other clones of MC using web based interfaces but they all failed.<br>
This time I wrote it in Java like the original and making much better progress.<br>
<br>
The controls are like the original.  Plus a few extras for testing:<br>
<ul>
<li>c = toggle flying mode
<li>r/f = fly up/down (no clipping)
</ul>
<br>
This is alpha software so please do not open bug requests.<br>

FAQ:<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b>Why?<br>
<b>A:</b><span>For many reasons.<br>#1 - It's fun<br>
#2 - I developed a plugin for MC once but
once the next release came out it didn't work anymore so I gave up on creating plugins for MC.
So I want to create an open source version where plugins will always work.</span>
<br>
<br>
Thanks.
