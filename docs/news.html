ChangeLog
=========

Aug 27, 2015 : v0.21 released!
  - added particles (uses : break block, tame horse)
  - added new camera views (F5 to toggle)
  - added jfcraft.move.MoveBase
    - new base class for moving entities
    - will become better AI logic for entities
  - bug fixes

Aug 18, 2015 : v0.20 released!
  - attempted to use SWT (GLCanvas) but their keyboard support is not designed for gaming
    - it doesn't generate key release events if multiple keys are pressed
      - a known bug since v1.0 and still present in v4.5
  - started using LWJGL/3.0 (which uses GLFW)
    - GLFW has a mouse locking feature which is better than using java.awt.Robot
    - GLFW can not set the window icon (feature is implemented in git, not released yet)
    - LWJGL uses libffi which in my experience is PAINfully slow
  - finally switched to GLFW (now part of JavaForce)
    - GLFW doesn't support icons yet but I added some JNI to overcome that (Windows only)
  - added block hardness
  - added clouds (see http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/105753/how-does-minecraft-render-its-clouds)
  - lots of improvements and bug fixes

Aug 1, 2015 : v0.19 released!
  - fix major opengl resource leak (crashing on some systems)

  - players armor is now rendered
  - new /import /export commands added

  - JNA has been completely replaced with JNI (now even faster)

May 18, 2015 : v0.12 released!
  - FPS doubled after using JNI to call OpenGL (JavaForce/8.0)
  - added enderman, zombie pigman, slime

May 7, 2015 : v0.11 released!
  - new blocks : Hopper, Dropper, Dispenser
  - all blocks/items/entities/dims/extras (including plugins) use dynamic IDs saved in the world
    - so there will be no id conflicts
  - reduced GC usage more (now better than the reference impl)
    - using a custom build of JNA (a modified version that creates less new Object[] arrays)
      - see github.com/pquiring/jna
    - javaforce.gl.GL - no more new Object[] arrays for each func call
    - FPS looks a bit faster and more stable
  - added a chat history
  - make sure to delete all worlds before upgrading
  - many bugs fixed

Apr 30, 2015 : v0.10 released!
  - major changes for performance, but nothing new
  - thanks to VisualVM GC usage has been greatly reduced
    - the biggest offender now is JNA - I have plans to improve it
  - java.io.Serializable has been replaced with a custom process which is much faster
    - see jfcraft.data.Serial*
  - moved Domino to a plugin
  - many bugs fixed
    - the dominos will always fall now - introduced BlockEntity to find them better

Apr 24, 2015 : v0.9 released!

    - hold right CTRL to talk (Push To Talk : PTT)

    - the client borrows code from jPhoneLite
    - even regular soft phones (like jPhoneLite or XLite) can call the server and join in the conference
      - the user acct can be anything, the password must be '12345' (which is a bad password) and then just dial '1234'.
  - finished the dedicated server
  - added Domino block as requested by my little nephew
    - no recipe so use a command to get some "/give @p domino 64"
  - torches stick into walls and drop if supporting block is removed
  - many more bugs fixed
