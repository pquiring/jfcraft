jump too high

starting position sometimes in blocks/water

If a world is created in dedicated server, the leaves are dark (no light).
  Does not happen in single player mode.

Minecart : speed, dir, dist are not synced with client.  Need to sync them are get rid of them.
  soln : don't move on the client side while in a vehicle (let the server move the client)
         - will be a slight delay : but that is expected in a vehicle

Shift+Craft > 64 items - some items are lost ???
